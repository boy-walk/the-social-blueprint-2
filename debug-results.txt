            [post_content] => The Eva and Marc Besen Contemporary Artist Commission I could have danced all night is a deeply personal exhibition inspired by Danielle Brustmanâ€™s grandmothers, Marta &amp; Dora. The evocative showcase, inspired by family, music &amp; heritage, invites visitors to immerse themselves in memory, language &amp; song. It is a timely exploration of themes such as legacy, identity &amp; the power of objects to hold &amp; share stories.

I could have danced all night is running alongside the JMA exhibition, A Secret Chord, which opens on 01 November 2024 through to March 2025. This exhibition is ticketed (and included in the price of Museum entry).
